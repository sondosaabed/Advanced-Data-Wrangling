    "Programmatic data cleaning has three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Define: write a data cleaning plan by converting your assessments into cleaning tasks.\n",
    "- Code: translate the data cleaning plan to code and run it to clean the data.\n",
    "- Test: test the dataset, often using code, to ensure the cleaning code works and revisit some of the elements from the assessment phase."
