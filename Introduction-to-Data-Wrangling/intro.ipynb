    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "We just walked through a real-life example of how a data analyst would approach a complicated use case by implementing the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Defining a question\n",
    "Here we define a question or set of questions around why we need data and the problem we're trying to solve. Examples of questions we can define:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"What is the highest dose of the drug that is safe?\"\n",
    "- \"How did drought affect this particular location?\"\n",
    "- \"Why are developer preferences around this tool changing?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Gathering data\n",
    "Data is gathered from multiple data sources (e.g., hospital equipment, handwritten notes) and often needs to be consolidated and transformed into a consistent format, like a .csv file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Assessing the data\n",
    "In this stage, data analysts will assess their data for issues, like missing data for a week or inaccurate values, such as a patient's weight being incorrectly reported.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Cleaning the data\n",
    "Data analysts will then clean the data based on the issues reported in Step 3, such as by removing missing values and adjusting inaccurate values to be correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Answering the question\n",
    "The final step involves answering the question raised in Step 1 (e.g., \"The highest dosage is xyz\")."
