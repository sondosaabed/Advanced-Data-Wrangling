    "> HbA1c stands for Hemoglobin A1c. The [HbA1c test](https://depts.washington.edu/uwcoe/healthtopics/diabetes.html) measures what the average blood sugar has been over the past three months. It is thus a powerful way to get an overall sense of how well diabetes has been controlled. Everyone with diabetes should have this test 2 to 4 times per year. Measured in %.\n",

Both are measured in units (shortform 'u'), which is the [international unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_unit) of measurement and the standard measurement for insulin.\n",
