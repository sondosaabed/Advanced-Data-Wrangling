    "- **Completeness** is a metric that helps you understand whether your data is sufficient to answer interesting questions or solve your problem.\n",
    "- **Validity** is a metric helping you understand how well your data conforms to a defined set of rules for data, also known as a schema.\n",
    "- **Accuracy** is a metric that helps you understand whether your data accurately represents the reality it aims to depict.\n",
    "- **Consistency** is a metric that helps you understand two things: whether your data follows a standard format and whether your dataâ€™s info matches with information from other data sources.\n",

Units of analysis can be individuals, groups, artifacts (i.e., items like books), and geographical units (e.g., states). Note that while a unit of analysis is the item you want to structure your data around, a unit of observation is the item you can actually observe.\n",

Note that both primary keys and unique keys can be used to uniquely identify records in a table; however, a primary key does not allow NULL values, whereas a unique key can allow one NULL value per column and can be used for additional uniqueness constraints on columns other than the primary key.\n",
